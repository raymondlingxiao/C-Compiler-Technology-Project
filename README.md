# C-Compiler-Technology-Project
Hi! Here is the course project that I've done independently in the Compiler Technology Course in China. 

This project intends to:

  (1)Build Lexical Analyzer --> rdlex.l
  
  (2)Implement recursive descent program for text.c without generating syntactic tree.
  
  (3)Rewrote rdcheck.c into recursive descent program with tree (rdparser.c)
  
  (4)Show program structure in command line.
